âœ… Java Programming Question 2: Photographer

Problem Statement:
Create a Java program to manage photographers, with functionality to:
1. Count photographers by specialization.
2. Find the second highest rated photographer.

ðŸ“Œ Requirements:

1. Create a class Photographer with these attributes:
- id (int)
- name (String)
- specialization (String)
- rating (double)

Include:
- A parameterized constructor (in the order above),
- Getters and Setters for all attributes.

2. Create a class Solution with a main method.

Inside Solution, implement these two static methods:

a. countPhotographersBySpecialization(Photographer[] arr, String specialization)
- Takes an array of Photographer objects and a specialization string (case-insensitive).
- Returns the count of photographers whose specialization matches.
- Return 0 if none match.

b. getSecondHighestRatedPhotographer(Photographer[] arr)
- Returns the Photographer with the second highest rating.
- If multiple photographers have the same rating, return the one that appears first in the input.
- If fewer than two unique ratings exist, return null.

ðŸ”„ Input and Output:

From main:
- Read inputs for all attributes.
- Call countPhotographersBySpecialization() and print:
  - Number of photographers in <specialization>: <value> if count > 0
  - No photographers found for the given specialization if count is 0

- Then call getSecondHighestRatedPhotographer() and print:
  - If a photographer is found:
    id-<id>
    name-<name>
    specialization-<specialization>
    rating-<rating>
  - If not found:
    Second highest rated photographer not available

ðŸ“˜ Notes:
- Use case-insensitive comparison for specialization.
- Preserve input order when resolving ties.

ðŸ“¥ Sample Input 1:
4
101
Meera
Wildlife
4.1
102
Raj
Portrait
4.2
103
Anita
wildlife
4.5
104
Veer
Fashion
4.8
Wildlife

ðŸ“¤ Sample Output 1:
Number of photographers in Wildlife: 2
id-103
name-Anita
specialization-wildlife
rating-4.5

ðŸ“¥ Sample Input 2:
4
101
Meera
Wildlife
4.1
102
Raj
Portrait
4.2
103
Anita
Wildlife
4.5
104
Veer
Fashion
4.8
Home Decor

ðŸ“¤ Sample Output 2:
No photographers found for the given specialization
id-104
name-Veer
specialization-Fashion
rating-4.8
